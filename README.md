 Book that I used for reference: Data Science from Scratch 2nd edition
 
- Natural_disasters_nlp: It shows the application of deep learning techniques and the use of the universal sentence encoder through an example of the entire process of creating and training a model to identify tweets as natural disaster or not.

- Simple_Linear_Regression and Multiple_Linear_Regression: Made without using libraries for machine learning, just raw python.
